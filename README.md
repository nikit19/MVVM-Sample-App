 # Android MVVM Sample App

This project is a simple Android application built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. It demonstrates the usage of modern Android development best practices such as **Kotlin Coroutines**, **Flow**, and **StateFlow** for handling asynchronous data streams and managing UI state in a reactive and scalable way.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Decouples the UI from business logic, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Simplifies asynchronous programming with structured concurrency.
- **Flow**: A cold asynchronous stream that sequentially emits values.
- **StateFlow**: A hot, state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates.
- **Repository Pattern**: Manages data operations and abstracts the underlying data sources.

  
## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: Programming language for Android development.
- **Coroutines**: To manage background threads efficiently and avoid callback hell.
- **Flow**: For handling reactive streams of data.
- **StateFlow**: For managing UI state reactively.
- **ViewModel**: To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

- **Retrofit**: For networking and API calls.
- **Hilt**  Dependency Injection for better code modularity.
